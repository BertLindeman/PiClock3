This project started out as a way to waste a Saturday afternoon.
I had a Raspberry Pi and an extra monitor and had just taken down an analog
clock from my livingroom wall. I was contemplating getting a radio sync'ed
analog clock to replace it, so I didn't have to worry about it being accurate.

But instead the PiClock was born.

The early days and evolution of it are chronicled on my
blog http://n0bel.net/v1/index.php/projects/raspberry-pi-clock

PiClock3 is a complete rewrite of PiClock (https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock).
It is based on python3 and PyQt5.   It is also much more modular and less monolithic.

At this point, this is a rough preview of the direction being taken for PiClock3.
For something useful that works use the original PiClock (https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock)
It is still being updated.

I'll be commiting many partially complete commits here as an easy means to
distribute code my PiClocks for testing.

No detailed instructions have been created.  Basic information follows.
