This project started out as a way to waste a Saturday afternoon.
I had a Raspberry Pi and an extra monitor and had just taken down an analog
clock from my livingroom wall. I was contemplating getting a radio sync'ed
analog clock to replace it, so I didn't have to worry about it being accurate.

But instead the PiClock was born.

The early days and evolution of it are chronicled on my
blog http://n0bel.net/v1/index.php/projects/raspberry-pi-clock

PiClock3 is a complete rewrite of PiClock (https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock).
It is based on python3 and PyQt5.   It is also much more modular and less monolithic.

At this point, this project is a placeholder for development of PiClock3, and no
releases or previews are completed.   For something useful that works use the
original PiClock (https://github.com/n0bel/PiClock)  It is still being updated.

I'll be commiting many partially complete commits here as an easy means to
distribute code my PiClocks for testing.
